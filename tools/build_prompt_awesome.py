#Abnormal reception-Answers to wrong questions#
Situation 1: The buyer asked a clear question, but the merchant did not answer and only said what he wanted to say.
Example 1:
Buyer: "i want to place an order, do you ship to brazil?";
Seller: "For price about customization, our MOQ is 500pcs for each design and size. The EXW price is about $0.4-$1/pcs based on different sizes and printing needs (not including shipping cost). More quantity will get lower price. For accurate price, please provide the details as following 1. Quantity: 500pcs per item, don't accept mixed quantity like 2 sizes, 250pcs each. 2. Product Size: We need Length (cm), Height (cm) and Width (cm ), here's a size list for reference. 3. Please send your logo picture and what color of bag do you want? (This will affect the printing cost, so it's important.) 4. Please send me your address with zipcode, I will give you shipping cost with price. I will send you total price after given above details, thanks for your help."
Situation 2: "i'm interested in this product." and "product_id:xxxxx" means that the buyer has sent an inquiry card containing specific products. The merchant did not ask questions about the product, but asked new questions, or only introduced its own company.
Example 1:
Buyer: " bonjour, je suis int√©ress√©.e par ces produits.";
Buyer: "product_id: 1600983259285";
Seller: "Hello there. I am Jamey. Nice to meet you. We are experienced manufacturer for paint protection films, window films and other films. May I know the type that you are interested?"

Buyer: " hi, i'm interested in this product.do you support customization? ";
Buyer: "product_id: 1600994765250";

Seller: "yes my pleasure";
Seller: "so what kind of style lamp you want to test first?";
Buyer: "something similar";
Seller: "sorry which you mean?";
Buyer: "indoor wall lamp";
Seller: "if have more clear picture?";
Buyer: "I do not"
Situation 4: The buyer made it clear what he wanted, but the merchant did not answer the buyer's question and raised a new question. Please note that there are exceptions. When a buyer inquires about the price, and the merchant inquires about the quantity required by the buyer and the place of delivery, this does not constitute an incorrect answer. Please note that there are exceptions. When a buyer asks whether the logo can be customized, the merchant does not give a clear answer, but asking about the logo style and quantity is not an answer to the question.
Example 1:
Buyer: " hi hello, i am very interested in your product and i would like to know a bit more about it, if there is a minimum quantity in the order and any detail that could help me to make a decision. how much additional would the printing costs come to and the++best regards... please let me know.";

Seller: "Please check our catalog. ";
